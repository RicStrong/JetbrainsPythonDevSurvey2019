# JetbrainsPythonDevSurvey2019
https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/

This survey's a bit longer than I was expecting. I'm generally interested in the "tools of the trade" but I'm also interested in seeing other trends as far as who's learning what and applying it where. 

Hopefully this will also give me some clarity on different topics within python that I may want to focus on learning next.
